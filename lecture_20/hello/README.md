After you have Elixir installed, you can execute the script in this
directory in one of two ways:

$ elixir hello.exs

$ iex
> c "hello.exs"

The first uses the elixir interpreter to compile and then execute
the code in the indicated file.

The second launches the Elixir REPL and then tells it to compile
and execute the code found in the indicated file.

See Lecture 20 slides for details.
