# Lecture 28 Example Code

Two XCode projects that demonstrate the use of blocks in Objective-C and
the use of Grand Central Dispatch.

Any recent version of XCode should be able to open, compile, and run
both programs. XCode can be installed via the Mac App Store or by
downloading it from Apple's Developer Portal: <http://developer.apple.com>.

There is nothing special about the XCode directory structure; if you
don't have access to XCode on your platform, you can still examine
the source code contained within the sub-directories. Objective-C
header files are *.h files and Objective-C source code files are *.m.
